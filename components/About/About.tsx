                        The livestream can be found on the All You Can Board YouTube channel on the day of the event, <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/AllYouCanBoard">here</a></b>. It will also be embedded on this page!

    Viewers can tune in at any time to watch Carlo, Dylann and their friends play board games and/or to make a donation. 100% of all donations will go directly to Sara Riel. The more money folks donate, the more entries they will receive into random draws for various board game-related prize packs, many of which have been sponsored by board game publishers. Every 5 dollars that you choose to donate will earn you one entry into every prize package, so youâ€™ll have plenty of chances to win one of these great prizes! (Limit of one prize package per person)
